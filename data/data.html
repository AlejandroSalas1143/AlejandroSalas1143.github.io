                <h2>Dataset description</h2>
                <p>
                    The Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset is derived from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
                    System (BRFSS), a health-related telephone survey conducted annually by the Centers for Disease
                    Control and Prevention (CDC). The dataset contains health information collected from over 250,000
                    individuals across the United States in the year 2015. It focuses on various health indicators that
                    are associated with the risk of diabetes. <br> <br>
                    The dataset includes the following key elements:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Number of Observations:</b> 253,680 survey responses.</li>
                    <li><b>Number of Features:</b> 21 feature variables related to health behaviors, chronic health
                        conditions, and the use of preventive services.</li>
                    <li><b>Target Variable:</b> <i>Diabetes_binary</i> — a binary variable indicating whether an
                        individual has diabetes (1) or not (0).</li>
                    <li><b>Classes:</b> The target variable is imbalanced, with a higher prevalence of non-diabetic
                        cases.</li>
                    <li><b>Data Source:</b> The dataset is a cleaned version of the BRFSS 2015 data, focusing
                        specifically on indicators related to diabetes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The feature variables include a mix of categorical and continuous data, covering aspects such as body
                    mass index (BMI), physical activity, smoking status, and other lifestyle-related factors that are
                    crucial in predicting diabetes. The dataset is particularly valuable for building predictive models
                    to assess diabetes risk and exploring the relationship between various health behaviors and
                    diabetes.

                <h3>Justification</h3>
                <p>
                    We have selected the <b>Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset</b> for this project due to its
                    significant
                    relevance to public health and the opportunity it presents for building predictive models. Diabetes
                    is a major chronic disease, particularly in the United States, where it affects millions of
                    individuals and poses a substantial burden on the healthcare system and economy. The dataset we have
                    chosen is derived from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which is a
                    well-established and robust source of health-related data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This dataset is particularly suitable for our project as it contains a large number of observations
                    (over 250,000) and a variety of health indicators that are essential for predicting diabetes. The
                    diversity and depth of the data allow for comprehensive analysis and model building, which are
                    critical for understanding the risk factors associated with diabetes and developing effective
                    predictive models.

                <h3>Relevance</h3>
                <p>
                    The relevance of the <b>Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset</b> is underscored by its alignment with the
                    project’s goals to apply data mining techniques to a real-world problem with substantial societal
                    impact. The dataset's focus on health indicators related to diabetes makes it ideal for exploring
                    the relationships between these indicators and the risk of developing diabetes. This dataset has
                    been successfully utilized in similar studies, including the one by Zidian Xie et al., where machine
                    learning techniques were applied to predict type 2 diabetes using survey data from the BRFSS. Their
                    study demonstrated the efficacy of using such data for building predictive models that can
                    facilitate early diagnosis and intervention, which is a key objective of our project. <sub><a
                            href="https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2019/19_0109.htm" target="_blank">[1]</a> </sub>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, the dataset's applicability is further supported by its use in public health research,
                    as highlighted in studies like the one published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, which
                    discussed the incidence of end-stage renal disease attributed to diabetes. This study emphasizes the
                    importance of early detection and prevention of diabetes-related complications, reinforcing the
                    value of predictive modeling efforts like ours. <sub><a
                            href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6643a2.htm" target="_blank">[2]</a></sub>
                </p>
                <p>
                    By utilizing this dataset, our project not only aims to replicate the success of previous studies
                    but also to contribute new insights into diabetes risk prediction. The large sample size and
                    comprehensive nature of the data provide a solid foundation for developing robust predictive models,
                    making it an excellent choice for our project.
