                For this Data Mining course, the group project involves the development of a comprehensive data mining
                project that is divided into multiple deliverables. The project encompasses data selection, exploratory
                data analysis, data migration to BigQuery, model preparation and training, and final presentation
                through a dashboard. Each deliverable is due on a specific date, and feedback is provided to ensure
                continuous improvement throughout the course. The final presentation will summarize the project,
                highlight key findings, and suggest potential future work.
